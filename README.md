# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Restarent-Review-project

The purpose of this analysis is to build a prediction model to predict whether a review on the restaurant is positive or negative. To do so, we will work on Restaurant Review dataset, we will load it into predicitve algorithms Multinomial Naive Bayes, Bernoulli Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression. In the end, we hope to find a "best" model for predicting the review's sentiment.

Dataset: Restaurant_Reviews.tsv is a dataset from google drive datasets which consists of 1000 reviews on a restaurant.

To build a model to predict if review is positive or negative, following steps are performed.
